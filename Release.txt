1.6.1

- Separated valkka.onvif and valkka.discovery into a [separate python package](https://github.com/elsampsa/valkka-onvif)
- VAAPI decoding doesn't switch ever again to software decoding even if there were errors
- Some rtsp connections were left "hanging" on some occasions of rtsp play and and stop were called almost simultaneously (caught with valgrind)
